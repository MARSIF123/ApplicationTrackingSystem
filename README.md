# Application Tracking System

## Description
An application developed to automate the application process for university students, featuring user and admin interfaces for managing applications and tracking statuses.

## Backstory

Hi folks! I graduated from the University of Gujrat, Pakistan, in September 2023. As part of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program, I collaborated with two other group members on our final year project: the Application Tracking System. This project was completed under the supervision of Dr. Abd ur Rehman (professor in the Computer Science department).

We recognized a common challenge faced by university students during the application process. Many students found it cumbersome to manage their applications, track their statuses, and submit required documents as it was all about paperwork. Inspired by this issue, we decided to develop the Application Tracking System as our FYP.

Our goal was to create a user-friendly application that would streamline the application process for students while also providing administrative tools to manage submissions effectively. The system allows students to register, submit various applications, attach necessary documents, and easily track their application statuses in real-time. Additionally, the admin panel offers features for user management and application oversight, enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.

Through this project, we aimed to bridge the gap between students and administration, ensuring a smoother experience for all parties involved. Our journey involved extensive collaboration, problem-solving, and learning, ultimately resulting in a solution that we hope will benefit future students.
